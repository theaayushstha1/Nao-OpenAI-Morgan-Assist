sound_localize.py - SoundLocalizer (Phase 4 / robot-sound-localize)

Subscribes to NAOqi's ``ALSoundLocalization`` and tracks the most recent
speaker direction. Optionally drives ``ALMotion`` to physically turn the
robot's head toward the sound source. Designed to live alongside the rest
of the ``nao/`` package; runs in py2.7 on the robot.

Why polling
-----------
NAOqi 2.x supports two consumption patterns for ``ALSoundLocalization``:

1. ``ALMemory.subscribeToEvent("ALSoundLocalization/SoundLocated", ...)``
   This pushes events into a callback registered against an ``ALModule``
   subclass that has been bound to a running ``ALBroker``. It is the
   officially-documented path but requires the host process to either be
   the robot itself (``naoqi-bin``) or to have constructed an in-process
   broker. The broker plumbing is heavy and conflicts with how the rest
   of this codebase opens proxies (we already have an ``ALModule`` for
   audio streaming, and registering a second one in ``__main__`` is
   error-prone).

2. ``ALMemory.getData("ALSoundLocalization/SoundLocated")`` polled at
   100 ms cadence. The same payload that the event would have carried is
   stamped into ALMemory each time the localizer fires; we just read it.
   Trade-off is up to one polling interval of latency (~100 ms), which is
   well inside the 300 ms requirement in PRD_v2 (Phase 4, line 271).

We pick (2) for robustness on this firmware. The class still exposes a
``start/stop`` lifecycle so any future swap to event-subscribe is a
drop-in change.

Event format
------------
``ALSoundLocalization/SoundLocated`` returns::

    [
        [bufferTimestamp_sec, bufferTimestamp_usec],
        [confidence, energy],
        [azimuth_rad, elevation_rad, head_x, head_y],
    ]

Azimuth is in the robot frame: 0 rad = straight ahead, positive = robot's
left (the same convention ``HeadYaw`` uses, so we can pipe yaw in degrees
straight to ``angleInterpolationWithSpeed``). Elevation is positive up.

Defensive design
----------------
On a developer Mac we cannot import ``naoqi`` and we have no proxies to
talk to. The whole class is therefore wired to behave as a no-op in that
mode:

  * ``start()`` returns immediately and logs once.
  * ``stop()`` is idempotent.
  * ``get_last_direction()`` returns ``None``.
  * ``turn_head_toward(...)`` returns silently.

This lets the rest of ``nao_execute.py`` (which constructs a ``SoundLocalizer``
unconditionally and uses ``get_last_direction()`` for the
``point_listener`` gesture) work in unit tests off-robot.

    NAOqi's ``SoundLocalization`` fires events ~10 Hz with the payload::

        [[ts_sec, ts_usec], [confidence, energy], [azimuth, elevation, _, _]]

    in robot frame (radians). This class polls ``ALMemory`` at the same
    cadence, converts azimuth/elevation to degrees, applies the
    ``confidence_min`` filter, clamps to the ``max_yaw_deg`` /
    ``max_pitch_deg`` envelope, and stores the latest sample under a lock
    so other threads (e.g. the gesture dispatcher) can read it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nao_ip : str
        Address of the NAO ALMain broker. Use ``"127.0.0.1"`` if running
        on the robot itself.
    nao_port : int, default 9559
    motion : ALProxy or None
        Optional pre-built ``ALMotion`` proxy. If ``None``, the class
        builds one at start. Allows callers to share an existing proxy
        and avoids redundant connection setup.
    max_yaw_deg : float, default 60.0
        Hard cap on commanded ``HeadYaw`` magnitude. NAO's mechanical
        limit is ~119 deg but anything past 60 is unfriendly to a person
        standing in front of the robot.
    max_pitch_deg : float, default 20.0
        Hard cap on commanded ``HeadPitch`` magnitude. Mechanical range
        runs roughly -38..29 deg; 20 is a comfortable conversational
        envelope.
    turn_speed_dps : float, default 30.0
        Head turn speed in degrees per second. Maps to a 0..1 fraction
        for ``angleInterpolationWithSpeed`` via ``_speed_fraction()``.
    confidence_min : float, default 0.4
        Minimum localizer confidence (0..1) before an event is accepted.
        Below this the room is too noisy or the source too distant.
    auto_track : bool, default False
        If True, the polling thread calls ``turn_head_toward(...)`` for
        every accepted event. False (the default) leaves head motion to
        the caller (e.g. the ``point_listener`` gesture).
    poll_ms : int, default 100
        Polling cadence in milliseconds.
