"""LedDriver -- ALLeds + ALAudioPlayer wrapper for the Phase 3 wake state machine.

The wake state machine (``nao/wake_state.py``) drives one of five named states:
IDLE, AWARE, ENGAGED, LISTENING, SPEAKING. Each maps to a different eye
colour + transition speed. ``LedDriver`` exposes a single, flat API the
state machine calls so the colour vocabulary lives in one place.

Two firmware-quirk things are worth knowing:

1. ``ALLeds.fadeRGB`` exists in two signatures. NAO V6 firmware accepts
   ``fadeRGB(name, packed_int_rgb, duration)`` -- the same form the existing
   ``utils/nao_execute.py:change_eye_color`` uses, so we know the robot
   honours it. Some firmware revisions also expose
   ``fadeRGB(name, r, g, b, duration)`` with floats. We *try* the packed-int
   form first (it's the one verified working on this fleet); on a
   ``RuntimeError`` we fall back to the float-tuple call. Either way the LED
   eventually lands on the requested colour.

2. ``ALAudioPlayer.playFile`` requires a path on disk -- it cannot play
   in-memory bytes. ``chime()`` writes a 220 Hz sine, 200 ms WAV to
   ``/tmp/nao_chime.wav`` once on first call (or after the file is missing)
   and reuses it on subsequent calls. The disk write is ~6 KB so the cost is
   negligible, and ``/tmp`` is tmpfs on the robot so we don't wear flash.

Off-robot guard
---------------
``naoqi`` only exists on the robot. On a developer Mac running
``py_compile`` / ``ast.parse`` we still want this module importable, so the
constructor catches ``ImportError`` / ``RuntimeError`` from ``ALProxy`` and
flips ``_disabled = True``. Every public method then no-ops + emits a single
warning. This lets ``python -m py_compile nao/leds.py`` pass and lets the
``__main__`` self-test exercise every preset without a robot connection.

Threading
---------
Multiple state-machine threads (and the conversation thread that toggles
``set_listening`` / ``set_speaking``) may call into ``LedDriver`` at the
same time. Each ``pulse()`` invocation runs on its own daemon thread; we
serialise proxy access with ``self._lock`` so a fade and a pulse on the
same group don't issue overlapping ALLeds calls. Pulses are tracked by
group name in ``self._pulses`` so ``stop_pulse(group)`` reliably halts the
prior worker before a new one starts.
