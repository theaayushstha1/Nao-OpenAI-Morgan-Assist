"""Streaming MP3 chunk player for the WS transport.

Receives MP3 audio chunks from the WS receiver (`nao/ws_client.py`) and
plays them back-to-back through ALAudioPlayer with no perceptible gap. The
public surface is `StreamTtsPlayer` — an enqueue/stop/shutdown player.

This file is the Phase 1 rewrite of the SSE consumer that previously lived
here. SSE parsing, head-touch / mic-energy barge monitor, and the `consume`
function are GONE — those responsibilities moved out:

  - SSE parsing -> `nao/ws_client.py` (now consumes WS frames).
  - Barge-in detection -> `nao/ws_client.py` (single source of truth).
  - This module just plays audio chunks smoothly and supports `stop()` so
    the WS client can interrupt instantly.

What was preserved from the old file (deliberately, do not change):
  - Per-chunk volume pinning (`ALAudioDevice.setOutputVolume(100)` and
    `ALAudioPlayer.setMasterVolume(1.0)`) BEFORE every play. Some
    background service on this NAO firmware drops the output volume back
    down between sentences; pinning once at startup is not enough.
  - Lazy ALProxy creation through `naoqi.ALProxy` using `nao_ip`.
  - MP3 path on disk: NAO's ALAudioPlayer cannot play in-memory bytes; it
    needs a file path, so each chunk is written to /tmp/nao_tts_<seq>.mp3
    and `playFile()` is called.
  - `print()` logging via `from __future__ import print_function`. The
    `nao-logger-main` agent will replace these with structured logging in
    a follow-up commit; until then keep the prints so we can debug.

Python 2.7 / naoqi only. All imports of `naoqi` are guarded so this file
imports cleanly off-robot for `python -m py_compile` and unit tests.
