Nao-OpenAI-Morgan-Assist 🤖
Overview

Nao-OpenAI-Morgan-Assist is a project that integrates the NAO humanoid robot with OpenAI GPT and Pinecone to create an intelligent assistant for the Morgan State University Computer Science Department.

The system allows the NAO robot to:

Listen to speech input 🎤

Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper

Retrieve relevant knowledge from Pinecone (MSU CS knowledge base)

Generate accurate replies with GPT

Speak responses back through NAO’s text-to-speech

This project was developed by Aayush Shrestha.

Features

🗣 Voice Interaction – Record and transcribe audio with Whisper

🧠 Chatbot Mode – Provides answers based on Morgan CS department knowledge

📚 Study Mode – Step-by-step teaching with examples and questions

💬 General Mode – Friendly Q&A and general assistance

👤 Face Recognition – Enroll and recognize users with stored encodings

🔐 Memory Manager – Saves and recalls chat history and user data

Project Structure
main.py             # Entry point – listens for wake commands (chat, mininao, chatbot)
chatbot_mode.py     # Handles chatbot mode: NAO → Whisper → Server → GPT/Pinecone → NAO
server.py           # Flask backend: Whisper, GPT, Pinecone, and Face APIs
wake_listener.py    # Wake word detection for NAO
audio_handler.py    # Handles recording and audio saving
memory_manager.py   # Stores chat history and user profiles
face_store.py       # Manages face encodings and enrolled users
