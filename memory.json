However, I can offer a general comparison based on common knowledge up to October 2023:\n\n1. **Bitcoin**:\n   - **Purpose**: Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency designed to function as a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. It is often referred to as \"digital gold\" due to its limited supply and use as a store of value.\n   - **Technology**: Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work blockchain, which is known for its security and decentralization but can be slower and more energy-intensive.\n   - **Adoption**: Bitcoin has the largest market capitalization among cryptocurrencies and is widely accepted and recognized.\n\n2. **Solana**:\n   - **Purpose**: Solana is a blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects. It aims to provide high-speed transactions and low fees.\n   - **Technology**: Solana uses a unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism combined with proof-of-stake, which allows it to process transactions much faster and more efficiently than many other blockchains.\n   - **Adoption**: Solana has gained popularity for its scalability and has attracted a growing ecosystem of dApps and projects.\n\n**Conclusion**: The choice between Bitcoin and Solana depends on your specific needs and goals. If you're looking for a well-established store of value, Bitcoin might be preferable. If you're interested in building or interacting with decentralized applications with fast transaction speeds, Solana could be more suitable. Always consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance when evaluating cryptocurrencies."

But my mentor, my professor just gave me, out of nowhere, just gave me and wanted me to work on robotics, which I had very little knowledge about. But instead of letting it be a challenge, what I did was I kind of went on the internet. I started looking up videos on YouTube, you know, and then I also looked up documentations and PDFs, along with like research papers that previously people worked on. And I also had a mentor who worked on it before me, like for the other semester, and I reached out to him, scheduled like a call with him, and I also asked him all the tech stack that it took. Then I started learning about all the different tech stacks, like PuTTY, WinSCP, and the FLAG server, and everything about how it connected. And then I finally, after a while, I got used to it. I used to take notes, I used to memorize some stuff, and I also used to like code like smaller chunks first, before I finally went ahead and started like designing a few movements, like stand up, sit down. Now I have actually implemented a lot of things to the robot. The robot can actually talk back, it can have a conversation with you. It can also do certain tasks that you let it, like go there and do something, dance, and then just sit down, and then don't talk. If I say it like that, it can also understand everything. So yeah, that was one of the times when I felt a little challenged, and that's how I overcame it."
